# Sprint 6: the GNOME Shell stage.  Everything below was already installed
# ad-hoc during the porting sprints and verified live; this stage wires the
# same builds into the chain idiomatically.  The two gir rebuilds (mutter,
# gnome-desktop) are drop-in same-version rebuilds over the postlc7
# installs, now with GObject introspection enabled, because gnome-shell's
# JS needs their typelibs.

# pygobject first: the Fil-C import-gi fix (the Sprint 4 build panicked on
# `python3 -c "import gi"`).  Everything below that runs g-ir-scanner or a
# python gi module at build time (libgweather's gen_locations_variant.py)
# depends on this rebuild.

# carries the postlc8 gnome-rr introspection Fil-C fixes; the copy in the
